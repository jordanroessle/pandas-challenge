The work I wish to submit is for Hereos of Pymoli.

I wanted more practice so PyCitySchools has also been included for personal use. 

In Heros of Pymoli, I have provided numerous dataframes to represent the player count, gender demographics, age
demographics, and analysis for the total playerbase, analysis of players by gender, and analysis of players by age.
There is also dataframes for the top five spenders, top five most popular items, and top five most profitable items. 

Furthermore, I have included a short analysis of the trends seen in these dataframes in analysis.txt.
